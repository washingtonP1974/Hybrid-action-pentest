This repository, you will find tool scripts that help with the resonance of:

1- Open doors, architecture services, among others

2- Virtual hosts

3- Fuzzing domain

4- Permission to scripts = chmod a+x (script)

## a) vhost script
This is code developed in Python3, designed to scan ports and Vhost,this script attempts to connect to each port in the range 1 to 1024, sends a simple HTTP request, and checks for indications of virtual hosts in the server response. Note that this is a very basic method and may not detect all virtual hosts.

## b) scanner
This is code developed in bash with the purpose of using nmap parameters that must already be installed on your machine, so when fuzing using the ffuf tool already installed on your machine, simply select some of the following options

Nmap = n

ffuff = w

Type the IP address: 10.10.0.288

And the following work will be executed by the script, outputting the results in the same directory where the example script was linked:
Services, architecture, fuzzing output
